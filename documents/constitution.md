## Introduction

Unnamed Arma Group is a gaming community developed around playing Arma 3 and other military simulation games. Our focus is on small-team tactics, exciting gameplay, and a positive and respectful community. We aim to provide all members a voice in the organization and a platform to share their ideas and opinions to help shape the future of the group.

## Core Values

Our organization is guided by a set of core values that inform all aspects of our operations, including gameplay, leadership, mission design, and conflict resolution. By upholding these values, we aim to provide an enjoyable and consistent experience for all members of the unit.

**Our core values are:**

- Be respectful, but not pandering.
- Be truthful, but not callous.
- Be right, but not arrogant.
- Be content, but not oblivious.
- Be innovative, but not reckless.

The importance of our core values cannot be overstated. They form the foundation of our organization and are upheld by all staff members. It is through the maintenance of these values that we are able to provide a high-quality experience for all members of the unit.

## Code of Conduct

In order to be a member of our organization, it is essential that you understand and agree to our Code of Conduct. This document outlines the rules that all members, regardless of their position within the group, must follow in order to create a positive and enjoyable environment.

### Rule 1: Respect Others

It is essential that all members of our organization treat each other with respect and refrain from engaging in bullying or harassing behavior. While we value banter and friendly ribbing, there are limits to this type of behavior. If someone asks you to stop, it is important that you do so immediately. Additionally, do not bring personal matters or family members into disputes in a harmful way. We also discourage the use of offensive or inflammatory language or actions.

### Rule 2: Discord Guidelines

We use Discord as our primary platform for communication and coordination. By joining our Discord server, you are agreeing to follow the guidelines set forth by the platform. As an organization that primarily utilizes Discord, it is expected that all members will adhere to these guidelines at all times.

For convenience, here is a link to the Discord Community Guidelines: https://discord.com/guidelines

### Rule 3: Follow the Leader

During gameplay sessions, it is important that all members follow the instructions and leadership of the designated team leader. This helps ensure the success and smooth operation of the mission. It is also important to respect the authority of the leader and to refrain from undermining their decisions. If you have concerns about the leadership or direction of a mission, please bring them to the attention of the leader in a respectful and constructive manner.

### Rule 4: Help Eachother

We are a community of players who support and assist each other. It is important that all members of our organization strive to help their fellow players in any way they can, whether it be offering assistance in gameplay or simply being there to lend an ear. By working together and helping each other, we can create a positive and enjoyable experience for all members of the unit.

## Punitive Actions

If a member of our organization is found to be in violation of our rules and guidelines, they may face disciplinary action. The severity of the punishment will depend on the nature and severity of the offense. Examples of disciplinary actions that may be taken include warnings, temporary or permanent bans from our Discord server or gameplay sessions, and the termination of membership. It is our goal to maintain a positive and respectful community, and we will take appropriate action to address any behavior that threatens this goal.

## Operational Policies

In addition to our core values and Code of Conduct, we have a number of policies in place to ensure the smooth operation of our organization. These policies are designed to provide a consistent and enjoyable experience for all members of the unit.

### Transparency Policy

At our organization, we value transparency and strive to be as open as possible with our members. We believe that open communication is essential for the health and success of any community, and we are committed to maintaining an open and honest dialogue with our members.

To this end, we encourage members to ask questions and voice any concerns they may have. We also make it a priority to keep our members informed about the inner workings of the organization and any major decisions that may affect them.

If at any time you have questions or concerns about the operation of our organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to a member of the leadership team. We are always open to feedback and suggestions, and we welcome the opportunity to engage in open and honest discussions with our members.

### Non-Profit Focus

Our organization is a non-profit community. This means that we do not operate for the purpose of generating profit, but rather to provide a platform for individuals with shared interests to come together and engage in their hobby.

As a non-profit, we rely on the support and contributions of our members to sustain our operations. We may ask for voluntary donations to cover the costs of maintaining our servers and other expenses, but membership in our organization is never conditioned on the payment of fees or the donation of funds.

We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in our community, regardless of their ability to contribute financially. Our goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members, and we are committed to this goal as a non-profit organization.

### Collaboration and Open Source

At our organization, we value collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and resources. We believe that by working together and pooling our expertise, we can achieve greater success and growth as a community.

In line with this value, we are dedicated to the principles of open source. This means that we strive to make our resources, including code, tools, and documentation, freely available and accessible to all. We believe that open source promotes collaboration and innovation, and we are committed to contributing to the open source community whenever possible.

We encourage all members of our organization to collaborate with one another and to share their skills and resources. We believe that by fostering a culture of collaboration and open source, we can create a stronger and more dynamic community.

## Voting and Elections

Our organization is run by a team of volunteers who are elected by the membership to serve in positions of responsibility. We believe that it is important for the leadership team to be representative of the membership, and we strive to ensure that all members have the opportunity to participate in the election process.

### Voting Eligibility

In order to be eligible to vote in an election, you must meet the following criteria:

- You must be a member of our organization.
- You must have an attendance rate of at least 50% for the past 4 sessions.

### Voting Process

Voting is conducted using the [Election Bot](https://github.com/zuedev/ElectionDiscordBot) created by and maintained by our Founder. The bot is designed to make the voting process as simple and accessible as possible, and we encourage all members to participate in the election process.

The voting method used by the bot is a [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) (STV) system. This means that you can rank the candidates in order of preference, and your vote will be transferred to the next candidate on your list if your first choice is eliminated.

### Election Schedule

We try to hold elections as frequently as possible to ensure that the leadership team is always representative of the current membership. The process for filling a vacant position is as follows:

1. One week before the end of the current term, the current holder of the position will announce their intention to vacate the position. Our Founder will then announce the vacancy and open the application process.
2. The application process will remain open for 5 days, and all members who meet the eligibility criteria are encouraged to apply.
3. The current holder of the position will then announce the candidates who have applied for the position, and the election will begin. The election will remain open for 2 days.
4. The election will then be closed, and the results will be announced. The candidate with the most votes will be declared the winner, and they will begin their term immediately.
